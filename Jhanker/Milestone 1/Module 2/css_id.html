    <p id="first">
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
        and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

    <h3>Paragraph 2</h3>
    <p id="second">
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
